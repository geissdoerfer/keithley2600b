# Introduction

The code in this repository is superseded by [this package](https://github.com/OE-FET/keithley2600).

Keithley 2600B are a series of programmable sourcemeters.
They can be accessed remotely via a VISA interface.
The programming relies on the builtin TSP script engine which uses a LUA-style syntax.

This package provides a python API for convenient remote programming of the SMU via Ethernet/USB.
